# Codecademy-Data-Science-Path-
This repository represents and shows my journey through the Codecademy Data Science Path. It includes notebooks which focus on different concepts that were/are being learnt.
This README will also be updated as I update the repo and advance in the path.
Note: not all notebooks/files added will show every project done or concept learnt in the path, as some were done in the Codecademy interface.

**DATA ANALYSIS**
1. Frida Project-made use of basic Python knowledge
2. Coded Correspondence-Decoding and encoding messages
3. Reggie Linear Regression-combined knowledge of loops, lists, arithmetic and functions to implement linear regression
4. (Portfolio Project 1) US Medical Insurance Cost -investigated a medical insurance cost dataset using the Python skills developed.
5. Product Defects-investigated certain attributes of the Poisson(7) distribution
6. NBA Trends- analyzed data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and explored possible associations.
7. Page Funnel Visits- analysed data regarding visits to cool t-shirt inc, to build a funnel(no of people who continue to the next step in a multi-step process.)
8. Airline Analysis-Explored and got to know a dataset on different airlines and their prices and derived conclusions.
9. Exploring Mushroom: practised visualising data from a mushroom dataset.
10. (Portfolio Project 2) Life Expectancy and GDP- analyzed data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.
11. Hurricane Analysis: explored functions in Python among other things
12. Cleaning US Census Data: getting the data provided into reasonable shape to make data visualisations.
13. EDA Diagnosing Diabetes:  used Exploratory Data Analysis skills to inspect, clean and validate data.
14. (Portfolio Project 3): Biodiversity -Interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

**MACHINE LEARNING**

16. Python Classes Medical Insurance: developed a system that made it easier to organize patient data by using knowledge of Python classes.
17. TennisAce: Created a linear regression model to predict the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits.
