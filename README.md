# Codecademy-Data-Science-Path-
This repository represents and shows my journey through  the Codecademy Data Science Path. It includes notebooks which focus on different concepts that were learnt.
This README will also be updated as I update the repo and advance in the path.
I am currently on the Python for Data Science 2 module. 
Note: not all notebooks/files added will show every project done or concept learnt in the path, as some were done in the Codecademy interface.
