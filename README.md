# Codecademy-Data-Science-Path-
This repository represents and shows my journey through the Codecademy Data Science Path. It includes notebooks which focus on different concepts that were learnt.
This README will also be updated as I update the repo and advance in the path.
I am currently finishing up the last portfolio project under the Data Science Foundation. 
Note: not all notebooks/files added will show every project done or concept learnt in the path, as some were done in the Codecademy interface.
